# ChatApp

## Objective:
To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

## The 5 Ws:
1. **Who**—The users of the mobile chat app. These could be friends, family, or other students on this course. The codebase will also be used by other developers working on the product.
2. **What**—A native chat app built with React Native, as well as all the relevant documentation.
3. **When**—Whenever users of the chat app want to communicate with each other.
4. **Where**—The app will be optimized for both Android and iOS devices. Expo is used for development, and Google Firestore is used to store the chat messages.
5. **Why**—Mobile chat apps are among the most commonly downloaded and used apps in the world. Knowing how to build a chat app is an indispensable skill and demonstrates React Native development expertise.
